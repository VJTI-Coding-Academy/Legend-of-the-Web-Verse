## 🎯 Main Goal

Our aim is simple: **Work with the community to help each other master the Web.**

This repository serves as a knowledge base where members act as both creators and learners. We adhere to the following principles:

1.  **Scalable Components:** Projects that showcase specific logic or UI features used in large-scale applications.
2.  **System Design:** Practical implementations of theoretical web concepts.
3.  **Creativity:** Members are encouraged to bring unique ideas to life.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from all CA members! Whether you are fixing a bug, adding a brand new project, or optimizing existing code, your input is valuable.

To ensure the repository remains organized and high-quality for everyone, we have a detailed set of rules regarding directory setup and branch naming.

👉 **[Please read the CONTRIBUTING.md file before pushing any code.](./CONTRIBUTING.md)**

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized to keep individual member projects distinct from core repository files.

```text
Legend-of-the-Web-Verse/
├── CONTRIBUTING.md        # Guidelines for contributing (Read this first!)
├── LICENSE                # Open source license
├── README.md              # This file
├── ...
└── projectname/      # Member Project Folder (e.g., weather-app)
    ├── assets/            # Images, videos, or demo screenshots
    ├── README.md          # Documentation specific to this project
    └── (Source Code in a folder)      # The actual project files (html, css, js, etc.)
```


## 🤖 Guidelines & AI Policy

### Code Quality
* **Readability:** Keep code readable and add minimal but useful comments.
* **Formatting:** Please use formatters like **Prettier** (for JS/HTML) or **Black** (for Python) before submitting.
* **Efficiency:** Do not create monolithic files. Break code into modules where possible.

### Generative AI
* ✅ **Allowed:** Using AI to debug errors, suggest syntax, or generate boilerplate code.
* ⚠️ **Restricted:** It is **highly recommended** that you write the `README.md` file of your project yourself. Documentation is how you prove you understand the code. Use AI only for grammar checks.

## 🔮 Future Scope

As the Web-Verse expands, we plan to introduce:
* **Issue Tracking:** Specific challenges and bug fixes posted on GitHub for members to solve.
* **Code Reviews:** Seniors will review PRs to provide industry-standard feedback.
