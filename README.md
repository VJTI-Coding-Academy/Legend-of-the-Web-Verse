# Coding-Academy-Legend-of-the-Web-Verse
Web dev educational repo for members of CA, VJTI

## Quickstart

1. Fork and Clone this repo Locally
2. Create your own branch
3. Create a directory with format
    ``` name_projectname```
4. Create a ```README.md``` within this directory to explain your project. Format is given at [demo readme](Awwab_Wadekar_Linkly_URL_shortener/README.md). Store images/ videos in ```assets``` directory in your project directory.
5. Create a ```.gitignore``` file ([example](Awwab_Wadekar_Linkly_URL_shortener/.gitignore)) as well to remove unnecessary files such as ```node_modules, _pycache__, .db ,``` etc. files from being pushed. Please do not use the ```*``` feature as this will cause your gitignore to affect other projects which may be conflicting in some cases.
6. Please keep your code readable, add minimal but useful comments, do not create too long files and use formatters like black(for python).

## Main goal

Our aim is simple, work with the community to help each other get better at web development.

This is done by creating projects in specific formatted directories that showcase some feature used in common web applications. these projects mainly show a single scalable component of a large scale applications, or even common system design patterns.

Members are encouraged to submit their own ideas and show their creativity. Use of Generative AI is allowed as long as the format of project is followed. However it is highly recommended that the member at least write the README file of their respective project on their own, with only taking the help of AI for syntax.

However, with time issues will also be put on Github for members to work on.
